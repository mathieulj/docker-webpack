# A simple Docker based webpack boiler plate

Initially started just for me to get more familiar with webpack.

## Dependencies/Setup

I use docker to keep my workstation clean as I play with software so I built this in accordance. Basically, internet access and a functional docker install should be all that is riquired to get up and running.

You could skip webpack and install docker & yarn but then why are you here in the first place?

## Getting started.

The script `quickstart.sh` will build a base image and fire it up in interactive devellopement mode.

Happy hacking.
